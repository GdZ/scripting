# Usage: ./check_named
#
# Description:
# This plugin determines whether the named DNS server
# is running properly. It will check the following:
# * Are all required processes running?
# * Is it possible to make DNS requests?
#
# Limitations:
# Currently this plugin will only function correctly on Solaris systems.
#
# Output:
# The script returns a CRIT when the abovementioned criteria are
# not matched.
#


# You may have to change this, depending on where you installed your
# Nagios plugins
